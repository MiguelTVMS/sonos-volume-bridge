# Hardware verification matrix

Run this matrix for every release candidate on a private local network with one
supported Sonos speaker and one physical output device per operating system.
Complete this matrix before treating a release as ready for general use. The
macOS package is Developer ID signed and notarized; the Windows installer is
currently unsigned.
Record the operating-system version, Sonos firmware version, speaker model, and
result in the release issue. Do not record device serial numbers, LAN addresses,
or diagnostic payloads.

## Shared Sonos checks

| Check | Expected result |
| --- | --- |
| Discovery and selection | Discovery lists the selected speaker by friendly name and stable UDN. Saving selection connects without exposing an address to the frontend. |
| Cached-address reconnect | Restart the app with network unchanged. The selected UDN is resolved through its cached local description URL before SSDP is used. |
| Sonos-originated volume change | A physical Sonos volume change updates local output after Sonos confirmation. |
| Local-originated volume change | A local volume change is coalesced, capped, reaches Sonos, and returns to `Synchronized` only after confirmation. |
| Mute synchronization | Mute is sent immediately when enabled; disabling mute synchronization leaves the other endpoint unchanged. |
| GENA lifecycle | Confirm a callback event, renewal before expiry, and status recovery from `Subscription degraded`. |
| Polling fallback | Temporarily block callback delivery. Confirm `Polling fallback` and recovery to event-driven synchronization after delivery resumes. |
| Reconnect and shutdown | Disconnect/reconnect the speaker network, then quit. Confirm reconnect backoff, no stale status update, and best-effort unsubscribe. |

## Windows checks

| Check | Expected result |
| --- | --- |
| Default output replacement | Change the default multimedia render endpoint. The adapter detaches, reattaches, and resumes synchronization. |
| Fixed output selection | Select a fixed endpoint and confirm default-device changes do not move synchronization. |
| Application write suppression | Sonos-confirmed local writes do not trigger a second Sonos command. |
| Device failure | Disconnect or disable the endpoint. The tray reports `Local audio unavailable` and recovers when available. |

## macOS checks

| Check | Expected result |
| --- | --- |
| Bundle signature | `codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=4` succeeds for the downloaded app bundle and reports the expected Developer ID identity. |
| Notarization ticket | `xcrun stapler validate` succeeds for the downloaded app bundle. |
| Gatekeeper assessment | `spctl --assess --type execute --verbose=4` accepts the downloaded app bundle. |
| Default output replacement | Change the default output device and confirm safe listener replacement and recovery. |
| Master/channel volume | Test a device with master volume and, where available, a channel-only device. Both apply the expected local value. |
| Expected-write suppression | Sonos-confirmed local writes within configured tolerance do not produce a second Sonos command. |
| Unsupported device | A device without software volume reports `Unsupported local device` clearly. |

## Release decision

All required rows must pass on Windows and macOS. Document an exception in the
release issue with its device class, user impact, mitigation, and a follow-up
issue before declaring a release candidate ready.
